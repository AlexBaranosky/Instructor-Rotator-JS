var SIFU_QUOTES = ["A Shaolin disciple, for example, is trained to be courteous and considerate, brave and righteous, assess problems and situations with calmness and clarity, and attend to duties with zest and loyalty. While the philosophy of many martial arts mainly focuses on how to be stoic and hurt the opponent, Shaolin philosophy teaches gentleness and a love for life. The twin pillars of Shaolin philosophy are compassion and wisdom.",

                "Daily practise the apparently simple exercise of breathing in and out slowly and deeply. At the end of this exercise, close your eyes gently (if you have not closed them earlier), and gently visualize that you are radiating good energy so powerful that - in some mysterious ways which you need not have to know why or how - even if the crooks found you, they could not harm you. Meanwhile, think of good thoughts and do good deeds whenever you can. Good energy is simply incompatible with minds and deeds that are evil.",

Just smile from your heart and feel, really feel, how relaxed, cheerful and happy you are. It is a big mistake to think I am being farcical. But I can tell you, in my capacity as a chi kung grandmaster, that this feeling of relaxation and cheerfulness from your heart may possibly be the best benefit of this exercise.",

Jesus answers clearly in the Bible, &ldquo;The Kingdom of God is in your heart.&rdquo; An excellent way to have a glimpse of God's Kingdom is to stand upright, be totally relaxed, close your eyes gently, and smile from your heart. As your heart opens, feel the presence of Jesus with you, and let the Grace of God flow over you. Conclude the session by giving a blessing to whoever you wish.  Practice this every morning.

If you know Chinese, especially Cantonese, you may have come across this expression: if your luck is good, evil cannot come near you. &ldquo;Good luck&rdquo; in Chinese is &ldquo;hao yun qi&rdquo;, or &ldquo;ho wan hei&rdquo; in Cantonese, which is word for word &ldquo;good-circulation-energy&rdquo;. A Shaolkin master has not only good circulation of energy, but also a powerful, trained mind. The good circulation of energy around your body acts like electricity, into which evil forces may not penetrate. Low level spirits, like ghosts, are actually scared of the radiant energy of a vibrant person. But that does not mean a Shaolin master would go about fighting black magicians. Shaolin teachings also place much importance on another principle: live and let live.",

This comes about not through moralizing by instructors, but through the nature of Tai Chi Chuan practice itself. It is more suitable than most other martial arts for character development, as the very nature of its training, with its emphasis on gracefulness, gentleness, and harmonious energy flow, is intrinsic to the development of mental freshness and cosmic harmony.",

You will be amazed at the depth and clarity with which you perceive and solve problems which appeared formidable before. And your friends will also feel the calmness and confidence that you inspire.",

                "You need not wait to live your life fully in the future; you live your life fully now. This is Zen, an essential aspect of our Shaolin training. For example, when you eat your breakfast every morning, you are fully aware of your eating your breakfast and enjoying it. You don't have to enjoy your breakfast the next day.
